This project aims to analyze seismic data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify and classify seismic events. Given the power constraints in planetary missions for transmitting high-resolution seismic data back to Earth, the goal is to develop algorithms that distinguish scientifically valuable signals from noise.
